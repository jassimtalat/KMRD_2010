                                                        Does your organization store sensitive personal data on computer networks?  While it is commonly known that computer networks are at risk of privacy breaches, your organization could also be at risk from off-line theft, such as a stolen laptop or stolen employee files, disks and other removable media. However your data is compromised, your organization will be held liable for damages that arise from lost customer and employee data.
														<div class="paraspacer"></div>
														As a business owner or manager, you may be concerned that an outsider or ex-employee will cause a security breach. However, current employees can also put your organization at risk. An existing employee could gain unauthorized access to non-public data on your network or accidentally send non-public data to an unauthorized destination.

                                                        Because your organization is responsible for sensitive data that you collect, such as employee or customer records and credit or debit card transactions, you could be exposed to lawsuits if any sensitive information is compromised. 
														<div class="paraspacer"></div>
														You may also have liability for breaches by your vendors who manage your sensitive data. Vendors account for 30% to 40% of all breaches<sup>1</sup>.  
														<div class="paraspacer"></div>
														In addition, if you have a privacy breach, laws in 47 US states and jurisdictions now require you to notify every affected individual by mail<sup>2</sup>. It could cost between $5<sup>3</sup> and $15<sup>4</sup> per compromised record just to comply with these privacy breach notices. To quantify, multiply the cost per record ($5-15) times the total number of individual records compromised. Because you probably self-insure this exposure, you will be liable.
														<div class="paraspacer"></div>
														In some states<sup>5</sup> new laws require you to implement safeguards to protect against unauthorized disclosure or use of their resident's private information. Failing to comply could result in a regulatory action. 
														<div class="paraspacer"></div>
														Privacy regulators at both the federal and state levels are aggressively enforcing privacy laws against small businesses<sup>6</sup>.  Defending a regulatory proceeding brought under any of the new privacy laws may require the use of costly law firms who specialize in privacy actions.
