The company manufactures very specific niche products and maintains a limited and specialized pool of loyal clients.  One evening after business hours, an electrical fire began near a chemical storage room.

The fire destroyed 9,000 square feet of key manufacturing machinery and processing operations, and the balance of the building received varying levels of heat, smoke and water damage.

															<li>Hired a disaster recovery firm to clean and restore the facility.</li>
															<li>Worked with the manufacturer’s clients to ensure operations would be back within the needed time frame.</li>
															<li>Cleaned the damaged but not destroyed portion of the facility to meet standards in order to continue manufacturing products.</li>
															<li>Collaborated to put a successful action plan in place to return the manufacturer’s business to normal with limited interruptions.</li>
														</ul>
														<div class="paraspacer"></div>
														PMA representatives monitored the restoration process from start to finish and regularly provided on site updates to the manufacturer’s key personnel. The manufacturer’s operations were returned to normal and restored to OSHA standards quickly enough to meet the business needs of its customers and the safety needs of its employees. A quick response from PMA and its hired disaster recovery firm ensured limited business interruption for the manufacturer and its clients.
