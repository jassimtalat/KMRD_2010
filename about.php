							What if an unscheduled event suddenly seizes control of your business? What if a workplace accident... vehicular homicide... lawsuit... cybercrime... fire or flood... or workplace violence suddenly threatens everything you have worked for?  
							<div class="paraspacer"></div>
							This is what happened to BP. This is what happened to Massey Energy. This is what happens everyday to organizations that arrive at one minute from normal with sirens screaming and lights flashing.
							<div class="paraspacer"></div>
							Our mission is to provide risk management consulting and property & casualty insurance to protect organizations worldwide against potentially catastrophic losses that wait on the other side of one minute from normal.  
							<div class="paraspacer"></div>
							Leading underwriters have joined with us to present case studies on how effective risk management processes, common sense and planning can anticipate and mitigate business losses that can turn your organization's world upside down.
							<div class="paraspacer"></div>
							Contact us before one minute from normal strikes, and we will identify and correct coverage and service gaps. We will work to prevent the losses that could bring your organization so far from normal it will take years, if ever, to recover.
