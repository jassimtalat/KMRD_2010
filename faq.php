									<strong class="mustardtext">Why have you built this website?</strong>
									<div class="paraspace"></div> As outsourced risk managers, we often see how an unscheduled event can spin out of control. It can take years for an organization to recover. Some organizations never recover. By helping organizations prepare for unscheduled events, we hope to prevent or at least mitigate the consequences of a calamity.
									
									<div class="paraspacer"></div>
									<strong class="mustardtext">How can my organization get ready for one minute from normal?</strong>
									<div class="paraspace"></div> Begin by clicking on the checklist included on this website. Every organization that submits a checklist will receive a One Minute From Normal toolkit. You can also contact us by <a href="contact.php">clicking here</a>.
								    
									<div class="paraspacer"></div>
									<strong class="mustardtext">Is the One Minute From Normal concept unique?</strong>
									<div class="paraspace"></div> No. What is unique is having the support of a professional team and processes in place before an event occurs.  When the worst happens, you are ready, you react and your business and profits return to normal. 
									<div class="paraspacer"></div>
									<strong class="mustardtext">How important is price when shopping for property and casualty insurance?</strong>
									<div class="paraspace"></div> 
									Price is important, but if a claim isn't covered because you bought "cheap" insurance, you haven't done a good job of protecting your business.  After an accident or incident occurs , no one ever asks how much they paid for insurance. Instead, they ask about access to coverage, the amount of coverage and the speed with which the claim is paid.
									<div class="paraspacer"></div>
									<strong class="mustardtext">Is insurance a commodity?</strong>
									<div class="paraspace"></div> Absolutely not. The quality of coverage, reliability and speed of claims support offered vary widely from one broker and carrier to the next. It is your insurance broker's responsibility to provide the best combination of service, coverage and price so you are ready when circumstances change.
