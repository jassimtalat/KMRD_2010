                                                        It was a happy day when an Enterprise Resource Planning software solutions provider won a hard fought multi-million dollar software/hardware conversion contract. The provider promised the client that its software solution would integrate all operating systems, resulting in a more efficient and cost-effective model.  Although all but one module was installed successfully, that last module experienced significant problems.

Market-leading Technology E&O coverage from Travelers pays those sums that the insured must pay for a covered loss that arises out of “your product” or “your work” and that is caused by an error, omission or negligent act. The policy does not limit coverage to damages arising out of specifically scheduled or designated products, nor is “your work” limited to specified operations or designated business activities.

                                                        Because ERP software systems can be complicated and involve a large number of people to design and implement, the litigation of ERP claims (and software claims generally) can be expensive.  Travelers works to take the “scary” out, so you can get on with business as usual.
